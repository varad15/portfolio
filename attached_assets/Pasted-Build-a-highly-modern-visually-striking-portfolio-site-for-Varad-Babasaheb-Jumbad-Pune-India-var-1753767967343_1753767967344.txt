Build a highly modern, visually striking portfolio site for Varad Babasaheb Jumbad (Pune, India; varadjumbad15@gmail.com; LinkedIn), Computer Engineering student at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune. The site should:

Be built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for silky-smooth animations and transitions.

Use advanced, highly aesthetic Google Fonts (such as "Inter", "JetBrains Mono", or "Space Grotesk" for headings, and "Manrope" or "Fira Sans" for body).

Use a modern "techy" UI vibe: glassmorphism panels, crisp shadowing, accent gradients in blues/purples, soft transitions, and animated section reveals. Dark mode required.

Responsive/mobile-first with accessible color schemes and font contrast.

Feature micro-interactions: animated hover/focus on buttons, project cards, social links, and navigation elements.

Deployable instantly on Vercel or Netlify, static only (no backend).
